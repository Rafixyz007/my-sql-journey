# SQL Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **SQL Journey** repository.

This repository documents my step-by-step progress in learning **SQL**, starting from core fundamentals and gradually moving toward more advanced concepts. Everything here is written with a focus on **clarity, practice, and real-world understanding**.

This is a **living repository** and will be updated regularly as I continue learning.

## 📘 Topics Covered So Far

* Basic SQL queries (`SELECT`)
* Filtering data (`WHERE`, logical operators)
* Sorting results (`ORDER BY`)
* Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
* Grouping data (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
* Removing duplicates (`DISTINCT`)
* Limiting results (`TOP`)

## 🧠 Learning Approach

* Concepts are practiced using simple examples first
* Queries are written clearly for readability
* Focus on **understanding why**, not just memorizing syntax
* Each topic builds on the previous one

---

## 🔜 What’s Coming Next

* Set Operators (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`)
* Subqueries
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window Functions
* Indexes & performance basics
* Real-world SQL problem solving
