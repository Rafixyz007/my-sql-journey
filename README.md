<h1 align="center">SQL Journey</h1>

Welcome to my **SQL Journey** repository.


This repository documents my step-by-step progress in learning **SQL**, starting from core fundamentals and gradually moving toward more advanced concepts. Everything here is written with a focus on **clarity, practice, and real-world understanding**.

This is a **living repository** and will be updated regularly as I continue learning.

## Purpose of This Repository

* Build a strong foundation in SQL
* Practice queries using real tables and scenarios
* Organize SQL concepts in a clear, structured way
* Serve as a personal reference and learning log
* Act as a beginner-friendly **portfolio project**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

* **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
* **SQL Dialect:** T-SQL
* **Sample Databases:**

  * `db_sql_tutorial`
  * `Sales`

##  Repository Structure

```text
sql-journey/
│
├── README.md              # Main overview (this file)
│
├── 01_basics/             # SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
├── 02_filtering_sorting/  # Conditions and sorting
├── 03_aggregations/       # GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT
├── 04_ddl_dml/            # CREATE, ALTER, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
├── 05_joins/              # All types of JOINs
├── 06_set_operators/      # UNION, UNION ALL, EXCEPT, INTERSECT
```

Each folder contains:

* `.sql` files with practice queries
* A short `README.md` explaining the topic

---

##  Topics Covered So Far

* Basic SQL queries (`SELECT`)
* Filtering data (`WHERE`, logical operators)
* Sorting results (`ORDER BY`)
* Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
* Grouping data (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
* Removing duplicates (`DISTINCT`)
* Limiting results (`TOP`)
* DDL operations (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`)
* DML operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`)
* Pattern matching (`LIKE`)
* Table relationships and joins:

  * INNER JOIN
  * LEFT / RIGHT JOIN
  * FULL JOIN
  * Anti Joins
  * CROSS JOIN
* Multi-table joins using the `Sales` schema
* Set Operators:

  * UNION, UNION ALL
  * EXCEPT
  * INTERSECT

---

##  Learning Approach

* Concepts are practiced using simple examples first
* Queries are written clearly for readability
* Focus on **understanding why**, not just memorizing syntax
* Each topic builds on the previous one

---

##  What’s Coming Next

* Subqueries
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window Functions
* Indexes & performance basics
* Real-world SQL problem solving

---

##  Notes

* This repository is updated **day by day**
* Mistakes and improvements are part of the learning process
* Suggestions and feedback are always welcome
