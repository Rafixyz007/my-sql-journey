## Aggregations & Grouping – GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, TOP

### What this section covers
This section focuses on summarizing and analyzing data using aggregate functions.

Instead of viewing individual rows, we calculate totals, averages, counts, and grouped results.

Key topics:
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- DISTINCT
- TOP
